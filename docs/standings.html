Our only Diamond rated team was of course a juggernaut, basically locking it up (>99%) by week 6. No one was truly eliminated until week 12, though Esther was basically out of it (<1%) by week 10. Shoutout to Harrison who missed the playoffs while having >84% chance of making it in week 5, while Jackie snuck in despite hanging out in the 30's and 40's for most of the season.</p>
